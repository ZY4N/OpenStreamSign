# OpenStreamSign
This project provides software (and in the future schematics) for an RGB-LED  sign that displays different animations when recording, streaming etc. in OBS Studio.

This is realized with software for the Espressif esp32 as well as a plugin for OBS. Communication is realized over wifi and always encrypted.

Configuration of the sign can be done over a web interface and further settings like animations can be set in the plugins config file.
